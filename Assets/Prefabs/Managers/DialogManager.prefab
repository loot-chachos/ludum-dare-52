  - "\xA1 Hola Amigo !"
  - Long time no see.
  - I was sure you will come back to take care of your garden with all that chaos
    happening.
  - I'm sure you remember how the job is done back when we were growing <i>melocoton</i>
  - Watered often, and wait a bit before harvesting your plants
  - Animals are really hungry back here. You might want to use those seed to feed
    them but I'm not sure it will be enough
  - Also, there is a bit of fertilizer. Not sure where it comes from...
  - Good luck amigo. And let's have a couple chupitos together when you're available.
